Creating and Managing Agents
Step-by-step guide to create and configure AI agents

Creating a New Agent
Navigate to the dashboard by clicking on the Dashboard link in the sidebar.
Click the "New Agent" button located at the top of the dashboard or in the empty state if you have no agents yet.
Enter a name for your agent in the dialog that appears. Choose a descriptive name that reflects the agent's purpose.
Click "Create" to generate your new agent. This will create a new chat window with default settings.
Agent Requirements
To create a functional agent, you'll need:

OpenAI API Key: You can use your global default key or set a specific key for each agent.
OpenAI Assistant ID: You'll need to create an assistant in the OpenAI platform and use its ID.
You can create OpenAI assistants at platform.openai.com/assistants
Optional Thread ID: For maintaining conversation history with the OpenAI API.
Managing Existing Agents
From the dashboard, you can:

Open an agent by clicking on its card to start chatting.
Access agent settings by clicking the settings button within the chat window.
Delete an agent by using the delete option in the agent's context menu on the dashboard.
Copy/duplicate an agent to create a new one with the same settings.
Best Practices
Create specialized agents for specific tasks rather than one general-purpose agent.
Use clear naming conventions to easily identify your agents.
Test your agent configurations thoroughly before deploying for real use.
Regularly update your agent configurations as you refine their functionality.

Chat Window Settings
How to configure your AI agent's chat window

Accessing Window Settings
To access the settings for a chat window:

Open the chat window for your agent
Click on the "Settings" tab at the top of the window
Basic Configuration
Window Name
The display name for your agent. Choose something descriptive and recognizable.

OpenAI API Key
Your API key for OpenAI services. This can be left empty to use the default key from global settings. You can find your API key in the OpenAI dashboard.

OpenAI Assistant ID

Thread ID
Optional: The ID of an existing OpenAI thread to continue a conversation. Leave empty to create a new thread automatically.

Advanced Features
JSON Response Format
Define a JSON structure for the AI to return structured data. This is crucial for action configuration. Example format:

{
  "action": "action_name",
  "data": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2" 
  }
}
Enable Text-to-Speech
Toggle to enable or disable voice responses from your AI agent. Voice settings can be configured in the global settings.

Enable Persistent Memory
Toggle to enable or disable persistent context memory for your agent. This allows the agent to remember information across sessions.

Persistent Memory Content
Text that will be included in every conversation with the agent. Useful for providing consistent context or instructions.

Using The Chat Window
After configuring your chat window settings:

Switch to the "Chat" tab to start interacting with your agent
Type messages in the input field at the bottom
Use the microphone button for voice input if configured
View your conversation history in the message area
Use the clear button to start a fresh conversation
Important: You must click the "Save Settings" button after making changes to window settings. Changes are not saved automatically and will be lost if you navigate away without saving.

================================

Actions Configuration
Setting up automated actions for your agents

What Are Actions?
Actions allow your AI agent to perform specific tasks based on the content of its responses. When the AI's response matches certain criteria, the system can automatically:

Make webhook calls to external services
Call additional OpenAI assistants
Execute internal processes
Make API calls to interact with external systems
Adding a New Action
Go to the chat window settings for your agent
Scroll to the Actions section and click "Add Action"
Configure the action trigger by specifying:
Parameter Name: The JSON field to match (e.g., "action")
Parameter Value: The value to look for (e.g., "search_products")
Select an action type (webhook, process, openai, api, display)
Configure the action details based on the selected type
Save the action to add it to your agent's workflow
Types of Actions
Webhook Actions
Send data to external web services via HTTP requests.

Configuration Options:
Webhook URL: The endpoint to send data to
JSON Format: Structure of the data to send
OpenAI Actions
Pass data to another OpenAI assistant for processing.

Configuration Options:
Assistant ID: ID of the OpenAI assistant to call
Thread ID: Optional thread for conversation continuity
JSON Format: Structure for formatting the assistant's response
Process Actions
Execute internal system processes like updating memory.

Configuration Options:
Process Type: Choose update_persistent_memory or execute_command
Memory Parameter: For memory updates, specify the parameter to use
API Actions
Make HTTP requests to external APIs with full control over method and format.

Configuration Options:
API URL: The endpoint to call
Method: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
Content Type: Format of the request data
JSON Format: Structure of the data to send
Display Actions
Display information directly in the chat interface.

Action Execution Flow
When your agent generates a response:

The system checks if the response contains JSON that matches any action triggers
If a match is found, the corresponding action is executed
Actions are processed in the order they are listed in your configuration
Results from actions can be displayed in the chat or used for further processing
Pro Tip: To debug your actions, use a simple JSON format in your assistant's instructions and include detailed error handling in your configurations.

Global Variables
Create and manage variables for use across all agents

What Are Global Variables?
Global variables allow you to define values that can be dynamically inserted into JSON formats and other configurations throughout the application. They're useful for:

Storing information that's used across multiple agents
Creating dynamic content that can be updated in one place
Personalizing responses with user or system information
Creating Variables
Go to Global Settings and select the "Variables" tab
Enter a name for your variable (e.g., "user_name", "company", "current_date")
Enter a value for the variable
Click "Add Variable" to create it
Using Variables
To use a variable in any JSON format or text field:

Insert the variable name surrounded by double curly braces: {{variable_name}}
Example:
If you have a variable named "user_name" with value "John", this JSON:

{
  "message": "Hello {{user_name}}, how can I help you today?"
}
Will be processed as:

{
  "message": "Hello John, how can I help you today?"
}
Managing Variables
For existing variables, you can:

Edit the value by clicking the edit button next to the variable
Delete a variable by clicking the delete button
Common Use Cases
Personalization
Variables like "user_name", "company_name", or "location" can personalize responses.

Dynamic Content
Variables like "current_promotion" or "product_version" can be updated once but reflected everywhere.

API Configuration
Variables like "api_endpoint" or "webhook_path" can simplify configuration management.

Pro Tip: Variables are especially useful in JSON formats for actions, allowing you to dynamically insert information into webhooks, API calls, and other integrations without modifying each agent individually.
